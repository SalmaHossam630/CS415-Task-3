  # Run a lightweight trusted workflow for PRs from forks. This uses pull_request_target
  # which runs in the context of the base repository; to safely test the fork's code we
  # explicitly checkout the head of the PR. Be cautious with secrets â€” this workflow does
  # not expose secrets to untrusted code.
